# 🖱️ Trol Mouse: Hand & Eye Controlled Virtual Mouse

Trol Mouse is a Python-based virtual mouse project that allows users to control their computer cursor using either **hand gestures** or **eye movements**. Built using cutting-edge computer vision and automation libraries, this project reflects my excitement for exploring natural and touchless ways of interacting with technology.

## 🚀 Features

- ✋ Hand gesture control (move, click)
- 👁️ Eye movement and blink-based control
- 🎯 Mode switching capability
- ⚡ Real-time responsiveness
- 🖥️ Works with a standard webcam (no additional hardware required)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **OpenCV** – Image processing and webcam integration
- **MediaPipe** – Hand and face mesh landmark detection
- **PyAutoGUI** – Controlling mouse movements and clicks
- **Pynput** – Keyboard/mouse event handling
- **NumPy** – Numerical calculations and optimizations
